This is a nice recipe for preparing a great italian dish called
"Linguine al Nero di Seppia" (linguine is a kind of pasta, nero di
seppia is the black ink from the cuttlefish, or sepia).

You need some seafood, but not much, then good italian linguine and the ink.
You can find the ink in some specialized shop, try to get the good one. If you are lucky,
you can even do it by yourself, from the cuttlebone ink bags (my granfather did it that way,
and is the best way).

First, the seafood.

1. Some pieces of cuttlefish.
2. Very few clams take 5 at most of dish.
3. Very few mussels, like 3, 4 for dish. 
4. Maybe a couple of shrimps, small.

You don't need much of all these, infact you can even not use them at all, so be conservative :)

Now, fry in good olive oil a little piece of garlic. As soon as the garlic becomes golden, throw it away.
Make the oil to cool down a little and then sprinkle some white wine on the oil and mix it.

Add the cuttelfish and the shrimps and turn the fire on again. After a while, add the
clams and the mussels, as they take less to cook. More or less at 3/4 of the cooking (you can spot it!)
add the ink with some water. The final result should be dense, but not gluey. Turn off the fire.

Pasta: Linguine, no discussion over this :)

Just prepare them the usual (italian) way. When they are done, take out the water, turn on the fire under the pot with the ink
and seafood, and put the pasta into it, mixing carefully, for one minute or less.

If you like, you can add some olive oil on top. Instead of salting the water for the pasta, you can use
"colatura di alici". Google for it, but I doubt you can find it outside Cetara/Salerno/Napoli.

Serve on pasta dishes, with a leaf of parsley.

<h1>OpenJDK Challenge</h1>

<h1>External Toolkit Implementation, a walkthrough</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Using the public and semipublic peer interfaces it is
possible to implement graphics backends for AWT and Java2D.
This requires the implementation of the complete graphics stack, including the Toolkit,
Graphics, and part of or all of fonts and image support.
This can be quite a large task, but has the advantage that there are no assumptions about the underlying platform.
</p>
<p>
This tutorial illuminates the external interfaces and
classes that are relevant for implementing a graphics backend for a
new system.  A JavaDoc description of the API is available as part of the
project.
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>

  <li>

  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Toolkit implementation</h2>

<p>
The starting point for implementing a graphics backend is the
<code>java.awt.Toolkit</code>.
</p>

<p>
The <code>Toolkit</code> abstract class provides many abstract methods that are
meant to create the native peers for the AWT widgets and implement
general toolkit functionality such as image handling, some font support,
and some printing support.
</p>

<p>
A large part of implementing <code>java.awt.Toolkit</code> is the
implementation of the AWT peer interfaces in the package
<code>java.awt.peer</code>.  One should follow the API documentation
for <code>Toolkit</code> and the required peer interfaces.
</p>

<p>
In order to use a new <code>Toolkit</code> implementation, pass a system
property to the VM like this:
</p>

<code>
java -Dawt.toolkit=your.toolkit.Classname
</code>

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> that one may also need to provide a
dedicated <code>GraphicsEnvironment</code>.
</p>

<h2>
GraphicEnvironent, GraphicsDevice and GraphicsConfiguration
</h2>

<p>
The <code>java.awt.GraphicsEnvironment</code> class is the other central entry
point for implementing a graphics backend.  It provides the
graphics devices and graphics configuration information.
</p>

<p>
In order to implement <code>java.awt.GraphicsEnvironment</code>, you will also have
to provide implementations of <code>java.awt.GraphicsDevice</code> and
<code>java.awt.GraphicsConfiguration</code>.  Please review the API documentation
for those classes as reference.
</p>

<p>
In order to use your own <code>GraphicsEnvironment</code>, pass a system property
to the VM like this:
</p>

<code>
java -Djava.awt.graphicsenv=your.graphicsenv.ClassName
</code>

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> that you will most likely also want to use your own <code>Toolkit</code>
implementation.
</p>

<h2>
Graphics2D
</h2>

<p>
As part of implementing the AWT peers and the <code>GraphicsEnvironment</code>, one
also must provide an implementation for <code>java.awt.Graphics</code>, to be
able to draw on the AWT components or images.  While the API only mandates
implementing <code>java.awt.Graphics</code>, it is very advisable to actually
provide a <code>java.awt.Graphics2D</code> implementation, because many
applications expect the <code>Graphics</code> object to actually be a <code>Graphics2D</code>
object.  Please refer to the API documentation of these two
abstract classes for reference.
</p>

<h2>
Fonts
</h2>

<p>
The <code>Toolkit</code> is also resposible for creating a <code>Font</code> peer.  However, this
interface is not actively used anymore.  There is an internal API for
implementing fonts, which consist of a couple of classes and
interfaces:
</p>

<pre>
<code>
sun.font.Font2D
sun.font.FontManager
sun.awt.FontConfiguration
</code>
</pre>

<p>
In order to implement a new font backend one has to provide a
<code>FontManager</code> and all the referenced support classes.
</p>
<p>
It is possible to reuse part of the existing <code>FontManager</code>
code even in newly written toolkit, even if this is not portable to different
implementation (see the internal interfaces documentation).  For the
most portable approach, just implement the methods described in the
FontManager interface.  Currently, there is an ongoing project to make
this interface more portable and improve its documentation.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Note</strong> that there is no public/semipublic API (like the AWT widget
peers) for fonts right now.
</p>
<p>
To use a new <code>FontManager</code> implementation,
pass a system property to the VM:
</p>

<code>
java -Dsun.font.fontmanager=your.fontmanager.ClassName
</code>

<p>
it is also possible to set this property in the static initializer of the
<code>GraphicsEnvironment</code> implementation:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
  static
  {
    System.setProperty("sun.font.fontmanager", "your.fontmanager.ClassName");
  }
</code>
</pre>

<h2>
KeyboardFocusManagerPeer
</h2>

<p>
It is possible to reuse the <code>FocusManagerPeer</code> in OpenJDK.
Currently, a process is underway to make it more portable and this functionality
should be ported into the <code>Toolkit</code>.  For now, if one would like to provide a
<code>KeyboardFocusManager</code>, one can set the <code>"sun.font.keyboardfocusmanager"</code>
system property to point to a valid implementation of
<code>KeyboardFocusManagerPeer</code>.
</p>

<h2>
Further Readings
</h2>

<p>
Please, refer to the <a href='Tutorial_Internal_Interfaces.html'>Internal Toolkit Implementation Tutorial</a> for more details on how to implement
the <code>Toolkit</code> Interface, without needing to reimplement
everything from scratch, and reuse most of the existing code in
OpenJDK.  Refer to the API documentation of the relevant classes and
interfaces for details of the implementation.
