/**
 * The source of events for Cacio Toolkits. Which events need to be generated
 * depends on the setup of the target. For fully managed environments (i.e.
 * all windows are managed by CacioCavallo), only mouse and key events need
 * to be generated, all other events are synthesized by the window management
 * code. For fully native setups, all kinds of events need to be generated
 * by the native backend, in particular: mouse, mouse wheel, key, focus and
 * window events.
 *
 * The Caciocavallo framework will poll the event source for new events,
 * process them if necessary, and post them to the AWT event queue. How
 * the event is processed depends on the type of event source:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>ManagedWindowContainer: the event data is processed in raw form by
 *     the container's dispatchEvent() method. The container is responsible
 *     for further processing, i.e. inferring synthesized events, and
 *     eventually posting to the AWT event queue.</li>
 * <li>CacioComponent: the event is turned into its correspondig AWT event
 *     and is processed by the CacioComponent's handlePeerEvent() method.
 *     The CacioComponent is responsible for further processing, and eventually
 *     posting to the AWT event queue.</li>
 * <li>AWT Component: the event is posted directly to the AWT event queue
 *     without further processing.</li>
 * <li>Other types or null events are discarded.</li>
 * </ul>
